## Description

The task is to design a controller/planner that enables a quadrotor (*Crazyflie 2.x*) to **safely fly through a set of gates and reach a predefined target despite uncertainties in the robot dynamics (e.g., mass and inertia) and the environment (e.g., wind and position of the gates)**. The algorithms will be evaluated regarding their safety (e.g., no collisions) and performance (e.g., time to target). We encourage participants to explore both control and reinforcement learning approaches (e.g., robust, adaptive, predictive, learning-based and optimal control, and model-based/model-free reinforcement learning). The controller/planner has access to the position and attitude measurements provided by a motion capture system and the noisy pose of the closest next gate. The controller can [send position, velocity, acceleration and heading references to an onboard position controller](https://crazyswarm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html#pycrazyswarm.crazyflie.Crazyflie.cmdFullState).

## Install on Ubuntu/macOS

We recommend Ubuntu 20.04 on a mid-tier laptop and GPU (e.g., a Lenovo P52 with i7-8850H/Quadro P2000)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/utiasDSL/safe-control-gym.git
cd safe-control-gym
git checkout beta-iros-competition
```

Create and access a Python 3.8 environment using
[`conda`](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html)

```bash
conda create -n safe python=3.8
conda activate safe
```

Install the `safe-control-gym` repository

```bash
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -e .
```

## Install `pycffirmware`

```bash
cd ..
git clone https://github.com/utiasDSL/pycffirmware.git
cd pycffirmware/
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

### On Ubuntu

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt -y install swig
sudo apt install build-essential
cd wrapper/
chmod +x build_linux.sh
conda activate safe
./build_linux.sh
```

### On macOS

Install [`brew`](https://brew.sh/), then

```bash
brew install swig
brew install gcc            # Also run `xcode-select --install` if prompted
brew install make
cd wrapper/
chmod +x build_osx.sh       # Assumes `gcc` is at `/usr/local/bin/gcc-12`
conda activate safe
./build_osx.sh
```

Also see how to install [SWIG](https://www.dev2qa.com/how-to-install-swig-on-macos-linux-and-windows/) and [`pycffirmware`](https://github.com/utiasDSL/pycffirmware)'s `README.md`

## Getting Started

Run the scripts in [`competition/`](https://github.com/utiasDSL/safe-control-gym/tree/beta-iros-competition/competition)

```bash
cd ../../safe-control-gym/competition/
python3 getting_started.py --overrides ./getting_started.yaml
```

**Modify file [`edit_this.py`](https://github.com/utiasDSL/safe-control-gym/blob/beta-iros-competition/competition/edit_this.py) to customize your controller based on [Crazyswarm's Crazyflie interface](https://crazyswarm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html#pycrazyswarm.crazyflie.Crazyflie)**

## Development and Evaluation Scenarios

A complete problem is specified by a YAML file, e.g. [`getting_started.yaml`](https://github.com/utiasDSL/safe-control-gym/blob/beta-iros-competition/competition/getting_started.yaml)

Proposed solutions will be evaluated in 5 scenarios with different challenges:

| Evaluation Scenario | Constraints  | Rand. Inertial Properties | Randomized Obstacles, Gates | Rand. Between Episodes | Notes |
| :-----------------: | :----------: | :-----------------------: | :-------------------------: | :--------------------: | :---: |
| [`level0.yaml`][link0] | **Yes** | *No* | *No* | *No* | Perfect knowledge |
| [`level1.yaml`][link1] | **Yes** | **Yes** | *No* | *No* | Adaptive |
| [`level2.yaml`][link2] | **Yes** | **Yes** | **Yes** | *No* | Learning, re-planning |
| [`level3.yaml`][link3] | **Yes** | **Yes** | **Yes** | **Yes** | Robustness |
| | | | | | |
| sim2real | **Yes** | Real-life hardware |  **Yes**, injected | *No* | Sim2real transfer |

> "Rand. Between Episodes" (governed by argument `reseed_on_reset`) states whether randomized properties and positions vary or are kept constant (by re-seeding the random number generator on each `env.reset()`) across episodes
>
> Note 1: the random seed used to score solution will be picked at the time of the competition
>
> Note 2: if the base scenarios do not allow to determine a unique winner, we will progressively raise the difficulty by, alternately, (i) adding intermediate gates and (ii) increasing the parameters of the random distributions and input/dynamics disturbances by 50% (except in `level0`).

## Scoring (v0.3)

A) For ALL levels (0-3, sim2real), solutions will be evaluated—on the **last episode**—by:

- **Safety**: avoid ALL *collisions* with gates & obstacles and *constraint violations*—i.e., only runs with 0 collisions/violations will count as TASK COMPLETION
- **Performance**: minimizing the *task time* (in sec.) required to complete the task (fly through all the gates and reach the goal)

B) For ALL levels (0-3, sim2real), solutions that accomplish A) will be evaluated—across **all episodes**—by:

- **Data & compute efficiency**: minimizing the *simulation/flight-clock time of the [no. of episodes](https://github.com/utiasDSL/safe-control-gym/blob/beta-iros-competition/competition/getting_started.yaml#L2)* (in sec.) plus their overall *wall-clock learning time* (in sec.) used by [`interStepLearn()`](https://github.com/utiasDSL/safe-control-gym/blob/beta-iros-competition/competition/edit_this.py#L288) and [`interEpisodeLearn()`](https://github.com/utiasDSL/safe-control-gym/blob/beta-iros-competition/competition/edit_this.py#L328) to improve performance

C) For ALL levels (0-3, sim2real), the top 3 solutions ranked by the criteria in A) and the top 3 solutions ranked by the criteria in B) will score 20, 10, and 5 points respectively. The sum of these points will determine the final classification.
